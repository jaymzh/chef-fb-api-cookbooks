Contributing to Phil's FB-API style Chef Cookbooks
=========================================

Our Development Process
-----------------------

I absolutely accept pull requests and will deal with the merging appropriately.

We use Cookstyle for Chef correctness testing and Rubocop for Ruby style
linting. Our rule sets are synced both internally and externally to ensure
consistent code quality and style for all.

Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
-------------------------------------

In leiu of a CLA, we use Chef's
[DCO](https://www.chef.io/blog/introducing-developer-certificate-of-origin)
system (which is based on the Linux Kernel DCO system).

Pre-requisites
--------------

First, thanks for your interest in contributing, we welcome pull requests!

Before sending a pull request to this repo it's important to remember that the
attribute-driven APIs here are a very different model than other community
cookbooks. In order to build that model, there's a specific way cookbooks need
to be written.

We highly recommend you ensure you read the upstream
[README.md](https://github.com/facebook/chef-cookbooks/blob/main/README.md) and
[Philosphy.md](https://github.com/facebook/chef-utils/blob/main/Philosophy.md)
as well as their
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/facebook/chef-utils/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
